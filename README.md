### Love.Ly  

This dating app gets what it really takes to sustain a long lasting relationship: shared values. Through the use of surveys and advanced matching algorithms, users are matched to one another on the basis of shared principles. We allow users to rank their own preferences for their partner's values across sense of humor, intelligence, physicality, materialism and empathy -- as well get category scores for each based on a standardized survey. Both are used to select the most appropriate matches for each candidate.
